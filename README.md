# Milestone 1 Project - YOGA FLOW

My first milestone project has been put together based on my learnings from the 1st to the 5th moudules of the Full Stack Developer course with Code Institute. This includes HTML, CCS, and user centric front end development.
YOGA FLOW is a fully responsive, custom built website which has been designed and built with the users needs first.

## UX
YOGA FLOW is a new Yoga studio. It is currently finding its feet and looking to grow its customer base.

External Users Goals: The YOGA FLOW website is for current and new customers to learn about the Yoga Studio and view the timetable of classes available to them. It also informs them of how to attend a class, and where to locate the studio.
Using simple and clear navigation, a clear schedule and informative text, YOGA FLOW will be able to provide the answers to the user questions.

* As a user, I want to be able to see what classes are happening and on which days and times
* As a user, I want to be able to locate the studio
* As a user, I want to know how to attend a class
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the Yoga studio

Site Owner’s Goal: The studio is looking to attract new customers and to minimise class enquiries by providing a clear class schedule and information of how to attend a class.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the class schedule
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the location of the studio
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors how to attend a class


## Features
Nevigation: The main navigation includes a link to answer each of the user questions, and is styled clear, simple and modern.
Class Schedule: I created a simple, clear and easy to read table using bootstrap which provides the answer to those wanting to know what classes are on, and on which days. The table is also clear and easy to read on mobile devices. There are many links to this section, including in the navigation and numerous buttons throughout the homepage.
Contact form: Easily found on the contact page, this form allows users to send any remaining questions they have about YOGA FLOW directly to the site owner.

Whilst the site currently states that the classes are on a 'drop in' basis, a future feature that I would love to add would be a class booking feature. This would be beneficial for when the studio becomes very popular and needs to limit class sizes.

## Tools Used
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create my wireframes, showing the positioning of elements on varying screen sizes.
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://google.com) - Photoshop was used to create my map image
* [Adobe Color](http://google.com) - This tool helped me to select my complementing colours
* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - I used this tool to check the validity of my HTML code.
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - I used this tool to check the validity of my CSS code.


## Project Setup
Upon starting my project, I used a blank repository rather than using the Code Institute template. Once I was informed of the mistake by my mentor, I restarted my project using the correct template.
As I had completed a lot of the index.html document in the old respository, I simply copied and pasted this to the new template. For this reason, the start and bulk of my index.html file has very few commits.
Initial and freequent commits for the index.html page are stored in the original repository, [which can be viewed here.](https://github.com/michellelclement/yoga-flow)


## Testing
TO BE COMPLETED

## Design

**Colours** 
I decided to stick to a very simple colour pallet which complements the Yoga mindset and audience. I wanted to use a soft coral/orange colour, complemented by a green shade. I used Adobe Color to pick the perfect color combination. 

Nav & Footer background: #FAFAFA 
Text: #212529
Body background: #FFF
CTA Buttons: #FF8970
Green: #57FFBD (unused)

Upon styling of the website, I decided that, due to the lovely colours of the photography, one accent color was enough and two was unnessessary. I decided to stick with the soft orange/coral shade of #FF8970 to highlight CTA's. This colour also completmented the imagary, as well as the off white and a dark grey.

**Typography** 
For the typography, I wanted to use a simple font that fitted with the calming nature of Yoga. I chose Quicksand for this reason due to both regular and capitalised text fitting this requrement, as well as the font being clear and legible on smaller devices. The font was installed into the head element of the HTML files, with a backup front of 'Sans-serif.'

**Logo**
the YOGA FLOW logo was created by myself, simply using the Quicksand font in uppercase, and a thicker font weight (600) to the rest of the website to make it stand out as the brand.

**Wireframes**
I used Balsamiq to create the website wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile screens for each page of the website, showing how elements would differ depending on the varying screen size.

[You can view all of the wireframes here](wireframes/wireframes-yoga-flow.pdf)

I did not deviate from the original wireframes, other than with specific styling of elements such as making the footer icons smaller.

### Acknowledgements

Thank you to fellow student and Slack Channel member Anthony O' Brien for helping me with some media query questions, and helping test my project on his Huawi device.

Thank you so Malia Havlicek for reviewing my website in the Peer-Code-Review Slack Channel

Thank you to fellow student Jos Velema. Whilst looking for assistance on linking the Hamburger Menu on the slack channel, I found his discussion with Marc Veldhuis who was looking for the same assistance. Jos pointed out Marc's mistake of not adding in the Bootstrap JavaScrip CSS tag, which fixed my problem also.

And finally a big thank you to my mentor Antonija Šimić!

In addition to assistance from my mentor and the Slack community, I also received some assistance in writing my code from previously answered questions on the following websites:
