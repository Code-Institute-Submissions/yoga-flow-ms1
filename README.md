# Milestone 1 Project - YOGA FLOW

My first milestone project has been put together based on my learnings from the 1st to the 5th moudules of the Full Stack Developer course with Code Institute. This includes HTML, CCS, and user centric front end development.
YOGA FLOW is a fully responsive, custom built website which has been designed and built with the users needs first.

## UX
YOGA FLOW is a new Yoga studio. It is currently finding its feet and looking to grow its customer base.

External Users Goals: The YOGA FLOW website is for current and new customers to learn about the Yoga Studio and view the timetable of classes available to them. It also informs them of how to attend a class, and where to locate the studio.
Using simple and clear navigation, as clear schedule and informative text, YOGA FLOW will be able to provide the answers to the user questions.

* As a user, I want to be able to see what classes are happening and on which days and times
* As a user, I want to be able to locate the studio
* As a user, I want to know how to attend a class
* As a user, I want to be able to contact the Yoga studio

Site Ownerâ€™s Goal: The studio is looking to attract new customers and to minimise class enquiries by providing a clear class schedule and information of how to attend a class.
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the class schedule
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors of the location of the studio
* As the site owner, I want to be able to inform visitors how to attend a class


## Features
Nevigation: The main navigation includes a link to answer each of the user questions, and is styled clear, simple and modern.
Class Schedule: I created a simple, clear and easy to read table using bootstrap which provides the answer to those wanting to know what classes are on, and on which days. The table is also clear and easy to read on mobile devices. There are many links to this section, including in the navigation and numerous buttons throughout the homepage.
Contact form: Easily found on the contact page, this form allows users to send any remaining questions they have about YOGA FLOW directly to the site owner.

Whilst the site currently states that the classes are on a 'drop in' basis, a future feature that I would love to add would be a booking feature. This would be beneficial for when the studio becomes very popular and needs to limit the class sizes.

## Technologies Used

HTML
CSS 
Bootstrap 


## Design

Colours: I decided to stick to a very simple colour pallet which complements the Yoga mindset. I used just one accent colour, #FF8970 to highlight CTA's which completmented the imagary, as well as off white and a dark grey.
